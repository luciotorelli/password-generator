## User Stories

- As a new user I would like to generate a password based on my requirements.
- As a returning user I would like to generate a new password based on new requirements.
- As a user during the password generation, I would like to see any errors caused by my input and how I can fix them.

---

## Site Owner Goals:

- Create an app that will generate a password based on the user requirements.
- The app is easy to use and understand.
- The app should capture any user input errors, handle them and tell the user how to fix it.
